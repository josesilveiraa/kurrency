# Kurrency

## What's Kurrency?

Kurrency is a second-economy plugin for Spigot servers under construction.

## TODO

- Refactor cache implementation.
- Test the plugin in real conditions.
- Add more features such as made transactions, transactions ranking and much more.

## Disclaimer

I didn't test the plugin, I'll do it when I have more time, don't use it.
